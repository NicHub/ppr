# 2PR ‚Äî Poly Protocol Reader

**One to read them all**

_2PR_ (pronounced _Two-P-R_ in English and _p√©p√®re_ in French) is a lightweight CLI tool to capture, read, and log multi-protocol IoT streams.

It provides a simple, unified way to inspect data from **serial devices, MQTT brokers, and WebSocket endpoints**.

## ‚ú® Features

-   Read from multiple interfaces with a single tool
-   Supported protocols: Serial, MQTT, WebSocket ‚Äî designed to be extensible
-   Output to console or structured logs (JSON, JSONL, YAML, plain text)
-   Lightweight and dependency-minimal (pure Python 3)
-   Tailored for **debugging, testing, and monitoring IoT devices**

## üîç Why 2PR?

2PR is a **small, Unix-style CLI utility**: quick to install, easy to script, and ready to use for everyday IoT development and diagnostics.

Unlike heavyweight frameworks (e.g. Node-RED) or single-protocol clients (e.g. `mosquitto_sub`), it is designed to remain minimalistic and start up in seconds.

## üéØ Target audience

Makers and developers working with Arduino, ESP32/8266, or IoT projects in general.
